### How does it work?
Usually many messaging apps use client server interaction in order to exchange the information, but here many number of clients are linked with a unique firebase io URL or simply the database.

Firechat uses simple replication process in order to get the messages.

- Install the required libraries by using: 
				**for python2**
				pip install -r requirements.txt

				pip3 install -r requirements.txt
- And then run python MainApplication .py 

### Caution

- The application might feel a bit laggy due to high refresh rate of incoming messages
